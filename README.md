# Alkospark

Idea is to profile alkos product catalog data and see what it provides. A couple of ideas

1.Seeing what is the most "valuable" item in the catalog. Basicly which item provides the most alcohol content with the cheapest price (Please see p_alko file)
2. Make a simple api where you could get the data. Could also add POST, DELETE etc.
3. Although there is very little data available it would be fun to mess around with some machine learning algorithms. The results would obviously not be relieble, but maybe a fun experiment.
